  <p><strong>Barça's new stadium replaced their old ground of Les Corts which with a capacity of just <br>
      48,000 was too small to accomodate the interest generated by a team led by Hungarian star Ladislao Kubala.<br>
      <br>
      The stadium was designed by architects Francesc Mitjans Miró and Josep Soteras Mauri, with the collaboration <br>
      of Lorenzo García Barbón, and it was constructed between 1955 and 1957, using mainly concrete and iron. <br>
      The whole project cost a staggering 288 million pesetas, which meant the club would spend the following <br>
      ears heavily in debt.<br>
      <br>
      Although it was originally going to go under the official name of ‘Estadi del FC Barcelona’, it soon came<br>
      to be popularly known as the 'Camp Nou' (the ‘new ground’), as opposed to the club’s old home at Les Corts. <br>
      It was not until the 2000/2001 season that, following a postal vote made by the Club membership, that the decision was made<br> to make ‘Camp Nou’ the official name of the stadium. Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a total of 19,861
      (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou to Estadi del FC Barcelona.
      <br>
      The stadium’s maximum height is 48 metres, and it covers a surface area of 55,000 square metres <br>
      (250 metres long and 220 metres wide). In accordance with UEFA stipulations, the playing area has <br>
      been downsized to 105 metres x 68 metres.<br>
      <br>
      With a capacity of 99,354, it is now the biggest stadium in Europe. However, the total capacity<br>
      has varied over the years owing to different modifications. When it was first opened in 1957, it held 93,053<br>
      spectators, which would be increased to 120,000 in 1982 on occasion of the FIFA World Cup. However,<br>
      the introduction of new regulations outlawing standing areas reduced the stadium’s capacity in the <br>
      late 1990s to just under 99,000.<br>
      <br>
      In the 1998-99 season, UEFA recognised the services and facilities at Camp Nou by awarding it <br>
      five star status. In 2010, in line with the new UEFA regulations, this category was replaced <br>
      by the new 'Category 4' title which corresponds to the stadiums which fulfill the most demanding <br>
      requirements with regards to facilities, services and capacity such as FC Barcelona's ground.<br>
      <br>
      Of the different facilities on offer inside the stadium, of particular note are a chapel next <br>
      to the changing rooms, the presidential box, the VIPs lounge, the press rooms, several television <br>
      studios, the Sports Medicine Centre, the Operative Control Unit (UCO), the veteran players area, <br>
      the FC Barcelona club museum, and the offices of all of the many different Club departments.<br></strong></p>
